"Laa shay'a waqi'un moutlaq bale kouloun moumkine". Using the phrase in a real life perspective.
This phrase, "nothing is true, everything is permitted" is more than just a good franchise tag line. It's a great way to view life,
while it could be viewed at face value, leading people to believe they can do whatever they want with no repercussions, the phrase means something a lot more.
To say nothing is true means that nothing is absolute. There is no single, linear path in life and that there are a thousand possibilities. You may think something in the future or present may be set to have happened, or you are destined to lead a certain life, but there is always a chance, no matter how small the percentage, that it can be changed. Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted does not mean we can run around stealing, robbing, hurting others etc with no backlash. To say everything is permitted is to acknowledge that you can do whatever you want in life, but you yourself must be ready to face the consequences of your actions. You must own everything that you do and the result will be yours alone. The phrase asks us to think of our actions deeply and ask ourselves if we are truly ready to deal with the outcome. Everything is permitted.
I know this is touched upon in the games a lot, but I wanted to express how the phrase, once adapted to a life outside of the fiction of the franchise, makes me view life in a new perspective.
Nothing is true, everything is permitted.
