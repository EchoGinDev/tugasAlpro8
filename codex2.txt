This is the dialogue between Altair and his master Al Mualim in the very first part of the “Assassin’s Creed” series.
When Al Mualim asks of the expert assassin
“What is the truth?”
“We place faith in ourselves. We see the world as it really is. And hope that one day all mankind might see the same.”
“What is the world then?”
“An illusion. One which we can either submit to, as most do, or transcend.”
“What is it to transcend?”
“To recognize that “nothing is true and everything is permitted”. That laws arise not from divinity but reason. I understand now that our creed does not command us to be free, it commands us to be wise.”
It is explained in a game that comes later in the series that “nothing is true and everything is permitted” is not doctrine but simply an observation of the nature of reality. Not meant to be cynical but merely descriptive.
“To say that ‘nothing is true’ is to recognize that the foundations of society are more fragile than we realize and that we must be the shepherds of our own civilization. To say that ‘everything is permitted’ is to say that we are the architects of our own actions and that we must live with the consequences, whether they be glorious or tragic.”
